History of website
Originally developed under lahyte.com for the completion of Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Diploma in Masss Communication. Took around 6 weeks, most of it was spent learning the basis of html and github, during Year 1 and 3. Began in 2019 (first publish in Dec 2022). Website was originally designed as a digital portfolio, with links to resume, personal information marketing oneself as an attractive employee. Without javascript, a lot of common internet functionality such as search, article sort and comments are missing. However, such functionality is unecessary for such a website as this.
